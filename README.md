# Plug-and-Play
This is a wrapper that is used with Shodan to find, PLUG into RTSP enabled cameras and PLAY them live. What you do with this is on you.

The script itself is fairly straight foward. Using your own key you are able to search Shodan (with the Shodan API) for RTSP enabled cameras and connect to them from a choice of 99 possible options.
Then when you choose the one you want you will then connect to it via the VLC python module and connect to them and stream them via the network stream function. then to end it you just exit out and you 
are good to go.
